BuzzFeed Clone

During the Decola Tech 2025 bootcamp, I built a simple Angular web application as a clone of BuzzFeed. The project allowed users to interact with various multiple-choice questions, similar to those found on BuzzFeed quizzes.
Key Features:

    Multiple-Choice Questions: Users could select options for each question, which mimicked the interactivity of BuzzFeed quizzes.
    User Interface: The UI was created using Angular components and directives like @if and @for to display dynamic content.
    Routing: Angular routing was utilized to navigate between different pages, such as the home page and the quiz results page.

What I Learned:

    Component-based Architecture: I deepened my understanding of creating reusable components in Angular and using them to manage different parts of the application.
    Data Binding and Event Handling: I gained experience working with data binding, including binding user input to application logic and handling events (such as selecting an answer).
    Routing and Navigation: I learned how to manage routes and implement navigation across different parts of the app to enhance user experience.
